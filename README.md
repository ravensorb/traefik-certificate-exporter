This tool can be used to extract acme certificates (ex: lets encrupt) from traefik json files. The tool is design to watch for changes to a folder for any files that match a filespec (defaults to *,json however can be set to a specific file name) and when changes are detected it will process the file and extract any certificates that are in it to the specified output path

# Installation

## Python Script/Tool

Installation can be done via the python package installer tool pip

```basah
$ pip install traefik-certificate-exporter
```

# Usage

```bash
usage: traefik-certificate-exporter [-h] [-c CONFIGFILE] [-d SETTINGS.DATAPATH] [-w] [-fs SETTINGS.FILESPEC] [-o SETTINGS.OUTPUTPATH] [--traefik-resolver-id SETTINGS.TRAEFIKRESOLVERID] [--flat] [--restart-container]
                                    [--dry-run] [-r] [--include-resolvername-in-outputpath] [-ll {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}] [-id [SETTINGS.DOMAINS.INCLUDE ...] | -xd [SETTINGS.DOMAINS.EXCLUDE ...]]

Extract traefik letsencrypt certificates.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c CONFIGFILE, --config-file CONFIGFILE
                        the path to watch for changes (default: config.yaml)
  -d SETTINGS.DATAPATH, --data-path SETTINGS.DATAPATH
                        the path that contains the acme json files
  -w, --watch-for-changes
                        If specified, monitor and watch for changes to acme files
  -fs SETTINGS.FILESPEC, --file-spec SETTINGS.FILESPEC
                        file that contains the traefik certificates
  -o SETTINGS.OUTPUTPATH, --output-path SETTINGS.OUTPUTPATH
                        The folder to exports the certificates in to
  --traefik-resolver-id SETTINGS.TRAEFIKRESOLVERID
                        Traefik certificate-resolver-id.
  --flat                If specified, all certificates into a single folder
  --restart-container   If specified, any container that are labeled with 'com.github.ravensorb.traefik-certificate-exporter.domain-restart=<DOMAIN>' will be restarted if the domain name of a generated certificates
                        matches the value of the lable. Multiple domains can be seperated by ','
  --dry-run             Don't write files and do not restart docker containers.
  -r, --run-at-start    Runs Export immediately on start (used with watch-for-changes).
  --include-resolvername-in-outputpath
                        Added the resolvername in the path used to export the certificates (ignored if flat is specified).
  -ll {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}, --log-level {DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}
                        Set the logging level (default: INFO)
  -id [SETTINGS.DOMAINS.INCLUDE ...], --include-domains [SETTINGS.DOMAINS.INCLUDE ...]
                        If specified, only certificates that match domains in this list will be extracted
  -xd [SETTINGS.DOMAINS.EXCLUDE ...], --exclude-domains [SETTINGS.DOMAINS.EXCLUDE ...]
                        If specified. certificates that match domains in this list will be ignored
```

## Examples

Watch the letsencrypt folder for any changes to files matching acme-*.json and export any certs managed by the resolver called "resolver-http"

### Script

Run it once and then exit

```bash
traefik-certificate-exporter \
                            -d /mnt/traefik-data/letsencrypt \
                            -o /mnt/certs \
                            -fs "acme-*.json" \
                            -r
```

Run it and watch for changes to the files

```bash
traefik-certificate-exporter \
                            -d /mnt/traefik-data/letsencrypt \
                            -o /mnt/certs \
                            -fs "acme-*.json" 
                            -w
```
