# Overview

This tool can be used to extract acme certificates (ex: lets encrupt) from traefik json files. The tool is design to watch for changes to a folder for any files that match a filespec (defaults to *,json however can be set to a specific file name) and when changes are detected it will process the file and extract any certificates that are in it to the specified output path

## Docker
```
docker pull ravensorb/traefik-certificate-exporter:latest
```
or to run it
```bash
docker run -it ravensorb/traefik-certificate-exporter:latest -v /mnt/traefik-data/letsencrypt:/data -v /mnt/certs:/certs -e "TRAEFIK_RESOLVERID=resolver-http" -e "TRAEFIK_FILESPEC=acme-*.json"
```
or with docker-compose
